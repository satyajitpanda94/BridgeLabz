   Desc 足> Simulates a gambler who start with $stake and place fair $1 bets until
   he/she goes broke (i.e. has no money) or reach $goal. Keeps track of the number of
   times he/she wins and the number of bets he/she makes. Run the experiment N
   times, averages the results, and prints them out.
   I/P 足> $Stake, $Goal and Number of times
   Logic 足> Play till the gambler is broke or has won
   O/P 足> Print Number of Wins and Percentage of Win and Loss.
